# AI-Art-Detection

Recent years have seen innovative advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the realms of image and video processing, speech and audio recognition, and pattern recognition, leading to the boom in AI art and deepfakes. The evolution of ChatGPT, Dalle-2, and Midjourney has sparked debate about whether AI art qualifies as true art and whether it will eventually displace human artists and creators. AI art generation models are trained on large datasets, often consisting of copyrighted art. Due to this, the resulting picture produced is frequently a manipulated version of the art piece, namely through various techniques - Cutmix, Adversarial Data Poisoning, Inpainting, and Style Transfer. This manipulation constitutes a violation of the rights held by the artists. 

<br> The fields of image forging (i.e., creating images that contain or originate from copyright content) and data poisoning (i.e., creating adversarially polluted paintings) have been areas of concern in the field of visual content synthesis using generative AI. This repo deals with exploring algorithms in AI art and copyright detection, highlighting best practices when working on images produced through the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), Adversarial Proximal Gradient Descent (APGD), and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD).
